## About
IC2 Classic Faithful x32 Resource Pack repository

## Status
Work in progress

## Note
The first upload is made using old-style textures for ores/ingots/dust/blocks etc.

When I'll finish this one, the modern variant will be added as well. Texture compression will be done once finished.

Be aware that this pack uses a different approach than the original x16 resource pack. Every texture is located in a common folder and accessed via texture_package.json of each machine/block. 

## Also
This resource pack is made for personal use, thus it should not be considered as being official.

You can use it, complete your pack or...
